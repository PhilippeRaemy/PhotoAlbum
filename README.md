# PicturesSorter
This is a bare winforms tool intending to visualize and compare two pictures at a time, and easily archive one of them (or both or none).
I created that on return from a wonderful vacation of 3 weeks in the National Parks in Utah, bringing back thousands of exciting photographs...

## Basic functionnalities are:
* pick directory
* display 2 pictures (jpg) from that directory
* navigate 1 picture forward or backward (using left / right keys)
* Move either of the pictures to Archive subfolder (using numpad 1 or 2 keys)
